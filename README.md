# SagaanTheEpic-Millin-Hack-SMH-Kernel

Important: 
First of all, credits goes to Zer0Mem0ry. He basically supplied the basic RPM and WPM which i had no time to do. The other people such as @wlan ( Love me :3), @Daax and afew others who helped me quite abit. This source is basically to help people learning Kernel and just teaching people on how to make an external using a Driver.

My Goals: 
My goals isnt to release a complete cheat ( if this gets enough support, i will ) but to make a cheat which VAC will find it difficult to detect. Things like using ObRegisterCallback and other things to isolate and making the cheat untouchable from a ring 3 Anti Cheat (VAC). A side note is that, i will try my best to hide the cheat and my main goal is to teach people on how to make a external cheat using a driver instead.

Just a thing i am trying to do, testing some things out and so on. This is for a game called csgo and basically are for people how knows what they are doing.
